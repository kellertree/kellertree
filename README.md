Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree was a prominent English actor-manager and playwright known for his contributions to the theatre in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

He was a Pioneer of Stagecraft: Tree was one of the first directors to pay significant attention to stagecraft and design, which helped elevate the overall production quality in British theatre. He was known for his elaborate and visually stunning sets, and he often collaborated with leading designers of his time, including Edward Gordon Craig.
